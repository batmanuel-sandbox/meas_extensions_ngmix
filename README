The meas_extensions_ngmix package provides lsst.meas.base.SingleFramePlugin
style wrappers for some of the fitting algorithms contained in Erin Sheldon's
ngmix package.  Ngmix creates models of 2d images comprised of multiple 2d
Gaussian profiles. This package allows those model fitting capabilities to be
used to create parameterized models of objects within the lsst.meas.base
measurement framework.

For more information on this code, please see the ngmix site at:

This package currently contains a plugin wrapper for doing PSF approximation
using the Expectation-Maximization fitter, and for modelling galaxy profiles
using the Simple Levenberg-Marquardt fitters. In the future, we intend to
extend this package to provide wrappers for some of the other Ngmix fitters.
